# Problem Set 2019

This repository contains set of ten programs in Python that were assigned for completion for Programing and Scripting in the first semester of 2019. 

[See here for the instructions](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/problems-pands-2019/raw/master/problems.pdf)

## How to run the code
* Make sure you have Python isntalled on your PC.
* From command line type python and the program name you want to run i.e. python sumupto.py .

## Programs descriptions

1. sumupto.py - This is a solution to problem 1 in problem set. The Program asks user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number.  
1. begins-with-t.py - This is a solution to problem 2 in problem set. The Program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T.
1. divisors.py - This is a solution to problem 3 in problem set. The Program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12.
1. collatz.py - This is a solution to problem 4 in problem set. TheProgram that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the
successive values of the following calculation. At each step the next value is calculated by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. The program end if the current value is one.
1. primes.py - This is a solution to problem 5 in problem set. The Program that asks the user to input a positive integer and tells the user whether or not the number is a prime.
1. secondstring.py - This is a solution to problem 6 in problem set. The program that takes a user input string and outputs every second word.
1. squareroot.py - This is a solution to problem 7 in problem set. - The program that that takes a positive floating point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
1. datetime.py - This is a solution to problem 8 in problem set. The program that outputs today’s date and time in the format “dayname, month daydigit year (time in 12H format)”.
1. second.py - This is a solution to problem 9 in problem set. The program that reads in a text file and outputs every second line. The program takes the filename from an argument on the command line. The test text file for this program is aladdin-story.txt.
1. function.py - This is a solution to problem 10 in problem set. The program that displays a plot of the functions x, x2 and 2x in the range [0, 4].
